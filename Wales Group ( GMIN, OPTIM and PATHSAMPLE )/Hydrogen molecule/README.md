# Configuration for Hydrogen Molecule Optimization
After optimizing the structure of the hydrogen molecule using the Gaussian software, I proceeded to use the PELE software. However, after several days of working with PELE, the results I obtained did not match those from Gaussian, indicating an issue in the process. Ultimately, after consulting the main developers of the software, I learned that PELE is primarily designed for energy functions that are smooth and can be minimized using standard optimization techniques. The developers were unsure whether the software could be adapted for small molecules like hydrogen, which are influenced by quantum effects. They suggested that I seek guidance directly from Professor David Wales for a definitive answer.
(PELE is a partial rewrite in Python of the GMIN, OPTIM, and PATHSAMPLE programs, which were originally written in Fortran by David Wales and his collaborators at the University of Cambridge.)

Based on the guidance provided by Professor David Wales, I learned that I needed to download the Wales group software, which includes GMIN, OPTIM, PATHSAMPLE, and several other programs, from their group's website. Furthermore, I needed to link and configure the Orca software with OPTIM, as it is compatible with several electronic structure packages, to ultimately determine the optimized structure of the hydrogen molecule using this method.

To perform the geometric optimization of the hydrogen molecule (Hâ‚‚) 
and related calculations, I prepared four main files that work together 
seamlessly:
