# Calculating the Geometric Optimization of the Hydrogen Molecule
To prepare the input file required for the Gaussian software and to analyze the output results, we can use the GaussView software. However, since hydrogen is a simple molecule, I used a plain text editor, such as Notepad, to create the input file. After entering the required information, I saved the file with a .com extension, which is the input format for the Gaussian software.

Once Gaussian completes the calculations, it generates an output file with the .out extension. To analyze the results and visualize them, we use the GaussView software.
