# Energy-Optimization-of-Molecular-Structures
"This repository contains codes, input files, output data, and analyses related to the energy optimization of molecular structures using software such as Gaussian, Orca, PELE, and OPTIM."
## Gaussian 

## Wales Group ( GMIN, OPTIM and PATHSAMPLE )

## PELE
pele : Python Energy Landscape Explorer.

Tools for global optimization and energy landscape exploration.

Documentation: http://pele-python.github.io/pele/

pele is a python partial-rewriting of GMIN, OPTIM, and PATHSAMPLE: fortran programs written by David Wales of Cambridge University and collaborators (http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/software.html).

The initial version of Pele was developed by Jacob Stevenson and Stefano Martiniani. ( https://github.com/pele-python/pele )

Currently, the advanced version of this software is being developed by the Martiniani research group at New York University (NYU), incorporating new advancements and features that make it suitable for more complex analyses. ( https://github.com/martiniani-lab/pele )
